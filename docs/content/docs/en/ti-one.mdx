---

This document provides instructions for deploying Youtu Embedding, HiChunk, and Youtu Parsing backend services on TencentCloud Ti-one platform.

# Overview

[TencentCloud Ti-one](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tione) is a one-stop machine learning platform that provides model training, deployment, and inference services. Using Ti-one, you can deploy the Youtu-RAG backend services without managing your own GPU infrastructure.

# Prerequisites

- A TencentCloud account with Ti-one and Tencent Container Registry (TCR) access

# Deploying Services on Ti-one

## Step 1: Prepare Container Images

1. Build Docker images following the respective Docker deployment guides for each backend service ([Youtu Embedding](/docs/en/youtu-embedding/docker_image), [HiChunk](/docs/en/hichunk/docker_image), [Youtu Parsing](/docs/en/youtu-parsing/docker_image)).
2. Upload the Docker images to [TencentCloud Container Registry (TCR)](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/tcr). You can follow the [TCR documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1141/41811) for instructions on pushing images to TCR.

## Step 2: Create a Model Service

1. Log in to the [TencentCloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and navigate to [Ti-one](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tione/v2/service/)
2. Go to **Model Services** > **Online Services**
3. Click **Create Service**

## Step 3: Configure the Model

1. **Service Name**: Enter a name for your service (e.g., `youtu-embedding`)
2. **Deployment Method**: Select **Standard deployment**
3. **Source of Machine**: Choose **Select from CVMs** if you have existing instances, or **Purchased on TI-ONE** to create new instances
4. **Model Source**: Select **Container Images** and choose the container image you just uploaded to TencentCloud Container Registry (TCR)
5. **Port**: Default to 8501, or specify a custom port matching your container configuration
6. **Spec**: Choose a GPU instance

## Step 4: Update the Service Endpoints

1. After creating the service, navigate to the service details page
2. Find and copy the **Call Address** under **Regular Service Calling** in the **Service Call** section. This will be your service endpoint for Youtu-RAG integration.

# Configuring Youtu-RAG

Once all services are deployed on Ti-one, update your `.env` file with the Ti-one service endpoints. You will also need to check your RAG configuration files as indicated in the [local deployment guide](/docs/en) to ensure compatibility.

```bash
# =============================================
# Embeddings (Ti-one)
# =============================================
UTU_EMBEDDING_URL=https://<your-tione-embedding-endpoint>
UTU_EMBEDDING_MODEL=youtu-embedding-2B

# =============================================
# Chunk (Ti-one)
# =============================================
UTU_CHUNK_BASE_URL=https://<your-tione-hichunk-endpoint>
UTU_CHUNK_MODEL=hichunk

# =============================================
# OCR (Ti-one)
# =============================================
UTU_OCR_BASE_URL=https://<your-tione-parsing-endpoint>
UTU_OCR_MODEL=youtu-parsing
```
