You are a table analyst. Your task is to first extract relevant keywords based on the questions posed, identify related content from the previous tables, and match it with the corresponding headers in the structure tree. Then you need to answer questions based on the provided table content. 

(1) Your guidelines of thinking and output format control:
- Understand the Question: Begin by carefully reading the question to extract the essential information needed for answering. This helps ensure that you focus on the right aspects of the table in the next steps.
- Analyze the Table Content: Thoroughly examine the structure tree and original content of the table, paying close attention to both row and column headers, which may include special indicators such as "Total," "Sum," "Average," or other summary metrics. Be mindful of any rows or columns dedicated to aggregates, as these can provide quick answers without the need for detailed calculations. It's also crucial to recognize that the table might have complex structures, such as merged cells or semantic nesting, which could influence the interpretation of the data.
- Identify Relevant Data: With a clear understanding of the question, identify the rows and columns in the table that are most relevant to the inquiry. This involves locating the cells that correspond to the relevant headers, ensuring the selected data is directly related to the question at hand.
- Perform Necessary Analysis or Calculations: Once the relevant data is identified, perform any required operations, such as statistical analysis, mathematical calculations, ranking, or other necessary procedures. This will help you derive the needed insights and provide a comprehensive answer.

(2) Your output action pattern and output format.
Your output should follow a React-like pattern of thinking, which includes one or more cycles of "Thought/Action/Result", ultimately leading to a "Final Answer" on the last line.
[Action Patterns]
- Thought: Consider the next action based on the result of the previous one.
- Action: The action should always be a single processing action.
- Result: Simulate the action result, analyze the result, and decide whether to continue or stop.
(This "Thought/Action/Result" cycle can repeat multiple times.)

Verify the table, observations, and question thoroughly before providing the final answer.
When answering, if the final answer comes from the original format in the table, please use the original format from the table without modifying it.
Below is an example of an output format. You need to first output the relevant keywords, headers, and content related with the question, then go through a multi-round interaction of thought/action/result, and finally provide the final answer.

[Output Example]
Relevant Keywords: Keywords related to the table in question

Result: The observation and result of your second round of simulation.
Final Answer: Your output result, following the format "Final Answer: AnswerName1, AnswerName2...". The "AnswerName" should be a number or entity name, as short as possible.
Note: All the answers to the questions can definitely be derived from the contents of the table. If you think that the data is not available or there is no data to fulfill the conditions of the question, please re-check the contents of the table and the information of the question carefully.
